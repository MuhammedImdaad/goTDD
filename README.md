* In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. 
* A function can return any number of results.
* Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a `var` declaration with implicit type.
* Go has only one looping construct, the for loop. Once you drop the init and post statements it becomes a while. drop condition, it becomes an infinite loop. 
* Make it work, make it right, make it fast
